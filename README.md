Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 

The goals and requirements for this app are to create a functional weight tracking system that can record a goal weight, add progress with dates, send an SMS message when the goal has been met, and delete/adjust prior lines of input. This addresses the need to track a person’s weight as they work on getting fitter. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Multiple pages were required to meet the user's needs; this made the application better by placing common functionality together and sectioning it. The user was kept in mind during development, so I organized buttons close to one another and paired them correctly. The designs were successful because I tested the app, found room for improvements, and implemented changes. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding the app by creating an outline of the app’s theme. Then, I worked on the most relevant features and ensured they worked before moving on. So, I prioritized the most important functionality first and worked my way down. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested the app many times on the emulator and my phone. I found the app works differently on my phone compared to the emulator, leading me to believe that the app needs to be developed in a way that is compatible with all devices. Testing is important to find errors and correct them before being released. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The biggest challenge I faced was getting the different Java files to work together as one. I was unfamiliar with how to do this in Android Studio. I overcame the obstacle by reading Android's documentation on how to connect them correctly.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I excelled at the XML file portion of the project. It allowed me to show my attention to detail and arrange objects in an aesthetically appealing manner.
